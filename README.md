# Data-of-Improved-random-forest-based-on-AFSA
====
This repository contains all the algorithm and data used in our paper "A parametric optimization oriented, AFSA based random forest algorithm: application to detection of cervical epithelial cells"
All files are stored separately in two folders: algorithm and relative data.
Algorithm contains the basic computation flow of the improved random forest based on AFSA, you can recurrent the code via this flow, along with the folder stores a clear chart of the flow which will help you better understand our algorithm.
